                <h2>Bonus: Strong Mental Health</h2>
                <p>Self-care has in itself been proved to increase your feeling of happiness
                    and mental health.</p>
                <p>But working on both self-care and self-worth seems to shield us from many types
                    of mental illness and emotional problems. Low self-worth has been identified as
                    a factor in stress, addictions, depression, anxiety, and relationship issues.</p>
                <p>Stress, depression, anxiety, and other mental conditions are often related to people,
                    who deal with low self-worth and low self-esteem.</p>
                <p>At this point, no one knows whether it's the mental condition and the stigma associated
                    with it that causes the low self-worth or whether it happens the other way around.
                    Either way, they build on each other, creating a persistent feeling of unworthiness
                    and despair.</p>

                <p>If you have low self-worth, you tend to search for something in your relationships based
                    on your own opinion of yourself. It affects all of your relationships, for example
                    relationships with relatives, your kids, your friends, and your partner.</p>
