        <h2><i class="fas fa-check-square"></i> Terms & Conditions</h2>
        <em><strong><p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you
        should make sure that you read them carefully before using the app.</p></strong></em>

        <div class="divider2"></div>

        <p>You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way.
            You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to
            translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the
            trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, belong
            to My True Value.</p>
        <p>My True Value is committed to ensuring that the My True Value app is as useful and efficient as
            possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its
            services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services
            without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
        <p>The My True Value app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order
            to provide the My True Value Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to
            the app secure. We, therefore, recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is
            the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating
            system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
            compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the My True Value app won’t work
            properly or at all.</p>
        <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that My True Value will not take responsibility
            for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The
            connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but My True Value cannot take
            responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi,
            and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
        <p>If you’re using the My True Value app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your
            terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
            be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while
            accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility
            for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home
            territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill
            payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
            received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
        <p>Along the same lines, My True Value cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the My
            True Value app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
            battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, My True Value cannot accept responsibility.</p>
        <p>With respect to My True Value’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app,
            it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct
            at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it
            available to you. My True Value accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you
            experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
        <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on – the requirements
            for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to)
            may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. My True
            Value does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or
            works with the version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always
            accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app,
            and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.</p>
        <p>Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in
            these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>

        <p>We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
            periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
            Conditions on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
